BattleShip game
    - Rules and game play:
        
        * Plot all of your ships by drawing an outline of each ship on the grid according to its size. For example, a battleship is four blocks, but an aircraft carrier is five blocks. This is illustrated in the key on the printable game page. Ships may not overlap.
        * Take turns firing upon the enemy by calling out plot points - for example: A-5. Mark your shot as a hit (X) or a miss (O) on your enemy ship grid according to your opponents reply.
        * When your enemy fires upon you, answer hit or miss, according to their shot. Mark your hit ships with an X on the "my ships" grid.
        * When the ships are sunk, you must inform your opponent that it is sunk and which ship it is, for example, "My aircraft carrier is sunk!".
        * The first person to sink all of the enemy ships wins the game.
